Proofable Node SDK is the software development kit to help users build solutions around `proofable-api` service using Node. It provides a set of promise-based APIs as well as more advanced callback and stream based APIs for dealing with the service. The promise-based APIs are convenient to be consumed in most use cases, while the callback and stream based APIs support more advanced features such as canceling and per-call gRPC options.
